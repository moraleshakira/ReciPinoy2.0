                <h1 class="recp-text-head">curacha</h1>
                <p>Curacha dish is a traditional crab food 
                    popular in the province of Zamboanga in 
                    the Philippines. This dish features spanner 
                    crab, also known as red frog crab, which can
                     only be found in the waters off the coast of 
                     Jolo, Sulu. Its name is a Chavacano phrase, 
                     which is a dialect spoken in the Zamboanga province.
                      In Tausug, the same dish is known as Kagang Pamah. 
                      
                       
                    <br><br>
                    The spanner crab is a hybrid crustacean. This crab's
                    color is red and stays that way even when cooked. 
                    The most frequent method of preparing Curacha crab 
                    is steaming or boiling to preserve the tastes, although
                     there are also other methods to make Curacha Curacha more 
                     appealing and delicious.One of such methods is 'adobo sa gata,' 
                     which is prepared with coconut milk, garlic, and ginger.

                    which means to grill, and kinilaw, which means to cook by

                <p>Binaki, also known as steamed corn tamales, is made using milk, butter, 
                    sugar, and eggs. Binaki sweet corn is naturally sweet, aromatic, and 
                    fresh from the farm to the table.
                    <br><br>   
                    Binaki is a popular dish in Cagayan De Oro and is also popular 
                    in neighboring provinces such as Bogo, Cebu, and Agusan del Sur, 
                    Misamis Oriental, and Northern Mindanao. Pintos is the Cebuano
                    word for it. If you've ever visited the northern portion of Cebu, 
                    you'll understand. Pintos (Binaki) is another Bogo City corn dish 
                    that uses condensed milk, butter, or margarine to flavor the main 
                    ingredient of pulverized maize. The corn sheath is then stretched 
                    around it.

                            <li>Remove the corn husk and make sure you do not tear them because you will use them as a wrapping for the tamales. Set aside.</li>

                            <li>Using a food processor or blender, process the corn for 3-5 minutes or until smooth and creamy. Transfer into a large bowl and combine the margarine, powdered milk, sugar and glutinous rice flour. Mix until well blended.</li>
                            <li>Use the husk and put a heaping tablespoon of corn mixture into the center. If the husk is too small, you may use 2-4 pcs and overlap them to each other. Fold husk lengthwise and bring two ends together.</li>
                            <li>Place them into a steamer basket and steam for 20 minutes over boiling water with medium heat. Remove from the steamer and let it cool for 5 minutes. Serve and enjoy!</li>
