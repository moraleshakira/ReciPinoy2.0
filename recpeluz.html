                <h1 class="recp-text-head">igado</h1>
                <p>Igado is a classic Ilocano meal made with pork tenderloin and pig guts like liver, kidney, 
                    and heart. In my opinion, this is one of the best Filipino dishes available. Some people, 
                    though, may need to develop a taste for it. There are numerous ways to define Filipino cuisine.


                    <br><br>   
                    
                    This is a one-of-a-kind spiced dish created with a range of seasonings and a few vegetables 
                    to complement the meat ingredients. It is also well-known for its utilization of pig innards, 
                    as previously stated. However, we shall delve deeper into the ingredients for this recipe later on.
                    According to studies, Igado was influenced by Spanish cuisine, as you may have guessed from the name. 
                    "Higado" means "liver" in Spanish, and some claim that Filipinos misheard it as "Igado," thus the current name.

                <h1 class="recp-text-head">dinakdakan</h1>
                <p>Dinakdakan is an Ilocano delicacy comprised of barbecued pig pieces tossed with 
                    onions and chili peppers in a calamansi sauce. It's great as an appetizer with your 
                    favorite drinks or as a main course with steamed rice.
                    <br><br>   
                    Pig's brain is used in the genuine dinakdakan recipe. This ingredient contributes to 
                    the dish's thick and sticky texture. We're not going to be as brave in this recipe feature 
                    because I couldn't get pig brain in the Northern Suburbs of Chicago, so we'll use mayonnaise. 
                    This dinakdakan dish is delicious.
                    <br><br>   
                    It is essential to ensure that each component is soft after boiling. You don't want your food 
                    to be rough and difficult to eat. It is critical to grill the meat. Your meal will be more tender.  
                    This will make eating more enjoyable.
