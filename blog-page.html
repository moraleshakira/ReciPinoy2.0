        <h2 class="post-head-blog">what is boodle fight?</h2>
        <p class="post-text-blog">A boodle fight is a Philippine military practices 
            in which a central mound of food is heaped high on banana leaves for soldiers 
            to share, often consisting of white rice and a variety of viands, fruits, and 
            vegetables. Diners are expected to eat while standing at the table, without the
             use of cutlery. Everything is eaten kamayan-style, which means "with one's hands."
        </p>
        
        <p class="post-text-blog">Nobody seems to know where the term "boodle" originated. 
            According to one source, it's American military slang for illegal treats. Another 
            theory is that it is derived from the English term "whole kit and caboodle," 
            which meaning "everything." One thing is certain, regardless of its origin.
             Diners are supposed to be aggressive with their food or risk ending up with 
             nothing, hence the name "boodle fight." It is necessary to "fight" for your meal. 
             To herald the start of the feast, a senior commander is believed to say, "Ready 
             on the left, ready on the right, commence boodle fight!"
                <br>
            An authentic boodle fight does not have any specific food. Anything Filipino 
            is acceptable as long as it is served on a banana leaf.  It's breathtaking to
             see all of this food heaped high on banana leaves. So much texture and color!
              Most of us today cheated and ate with silverware, but the true Filipino boodle 
              experience requires you to eat with your hands exclusively. A boodle fight is a
               better way to greet foreign visitors to the Philippines than a boodle feast. They 
               will not only eat Filipino food on banana leaves, but they will also learn what it
                is like to eat with their hands and share food with their families.
